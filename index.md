Hello, I'm Dr. Erin May, and I provide peaceful, in-home euthanasia for dogs and cats. I understand how difficult it is to say goodbye to a beloved pet, which is why I strive to make this transition as gentle and stress-free as possible.

By offering care in your home, I help ensure that your pet's final moments are filled with love, familiarity, and serenity. My approach is guided by compassion, respect, and a deep commitment to honoring the bond you share with your pet.

My goal is to provide a calm and supportive experience for both you and your pet. Every family's journey is unique, and I am here to offer guidance, comfort, and a peaceful farewell when the time comes. Choosing in-home euthanasia allows your pet to be surrounded by the people and environment they know best, easing their transition with dignity and grace. It is my privilege to help pets pass with the same love and care they have given throughout their lives.
