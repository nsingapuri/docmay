Deciding the appropriate time to say goodbye to a beloved pet is one of the hardest choices a pet owner can face. A **Quality of Life Assessment** appointment can help you determine whether euthanasia is the most compassionate option for your companion. Dr. Erin May will gently guide you through this difficult decision, evaluating your pet’s comfort, mobility, and overall well-being.

## Quality of Life Assessment for Your Pet

Dr. May offers these assessments in the comfort of your home within the greater San Antonio area or virtually via Zoom for those outside her service area. During the appointment, she will discuss your pet’s current condition, answer your questions, and provide honest, professional guidance. If euthanasia is not yet the best choice, she can suggest ways to improve your pet’s comfort in their remaining time. If euthanasia is appropriate, she will support you in making a peaceful and dignified plan. No matter the outcome, you are not alone—Dr. May is here to help you navigate this emotional journey with care and compassion.
