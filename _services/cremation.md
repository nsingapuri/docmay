Deciding how to care for your pets remains is a deeply personal choice. I have several options available to help you honor your pet in a way that feels right for you and your family.

## Self-Burial
If you choose to bury your pet at home, be sure to check local regulations regarding pet burials. Select a location away from water sources, and dig a grave at least three feet deep to prevent disturbance by wildlife. You may wish to wrap your pet in a biodegradable cloth or place them in a pet casket for a more formal farewell.

## Communal Cremation
With this option, I'll take your pet with me and (s)he will be cremated alongside others. Their ashes will not be returned to you. This is a simple and respectful choice for those who do not wish to keep ashes but still want a dignified aftercare option.

## Individual Cremation
If you would like your pet’s ashes returned, individual cremation is the best option. After the cremation process is complete, you will receive their ashes in a urn of your choosing, allowing you to keep or scatter them in a meaningful location. You'll also get a commemorative paw print and care bag.

## Aquamation
Also known as water cremation, aquamation is a gentle, eco-friendly cremation alternative that uses water and natural alkaline processes to break down the body. This method is available for those seeking a more environmentally conscious way to say goodbye.

If you have any questions or need help making arrangements, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I am here to support you through this difficult time.
